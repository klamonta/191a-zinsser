# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Kyla Lamontagne

In Zinsser’s “On Writing Well” chapters 2 and 3, the author says that good writing needs to be clear and short. It is the writer’s responsibility to write deliberately, cutting out any extra “fluff” and keeping their point easy to understand. If the reader cannot understand the writing, the writer failed reaching the goal. There are many words that count as “clutter”. Usually these words are long, complex, and used in order to sound important. Whenever a more common, shorter word can be used instead of clutter it should be.
